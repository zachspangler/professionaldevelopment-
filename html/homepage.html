						<h4>Quantitative</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Gathered and interpreted financial information effectively forming data into meaningful
									and concise analyses to help drive top and bottom-line growth. I worked primarily with a
									cross-functional brand strategy team consisting of Marketing, Sales, Technical and Supply Chain
									to develop and forecast potential financial impact of new products to the division.
								</li>
								<li>The role involved evaluating and providing opinions that influence the overall internal
									control environment throughout all Nestlé North American locations. I provided management
									support, which includes cost recovery efforts, fraud investigations, and business process
									and contract compliance reviews.
								</li>
								<li>When I joined the company, they had little visibility to key business metrics
									(i.e. product profitability, monthly sales, SOH forecast, etc.). I have continually developed
									reports to provide visibility about profitability, sales, and inventory. Allowing the company
									to make more informed business decisions.
								</li>

					<h4>Maintaining Balance</h4>
						<p>My jobs have tended to be more qualitative than quantitative relying more on the logical,
							mathematical side of my brain to be successful with my job. One of the reasons I love the idea
							of entrepreneurship is because I think it has an amazing interaction of qualitative than
							quantitative attributes. Today, I balance the qualitative demands for work and coding bootcamp
							with interactions with friends and family as well as using sports as an outlet.

				<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
				<p><strong>v 1.0.0</strong> Hi, my name is Zach. I build web applications to eliminate headaches for
						individuals and small to medium-sized businesses. I am currently working on an application that
						eliminates all work associated with the processing and paying personal bills. Has this ever been
						a pain point for you?
