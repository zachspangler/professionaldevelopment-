		<h3>Week 1 Reflections</h3>
		<p>Week one was great. I am excited to be in class and have loved every minute of class. I am looking forward
			to more projects and additional coding time. I learn best by doing something and applying the theoretical
			knowledge we learn in lectures to real-life projects.<p>
		<p>I am also enjoying Dylan and admire how much of his own personality he brings to the classroom.</p>
		<p>I am also planning on using this Pro Dev document as a way to practice some HTML, CSS and eventually
			JavaScript techniques. I hope this is ok, if not please let me know.</p>
