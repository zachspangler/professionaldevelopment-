			<h3>Week 3 Reflections</h3>
			<p>Things are coming together. I completed alpha on my first web application and setup my local server to host the application. I still need to review my code to make it more secure but using PHP and a mySQL databased the app is working, EXCITING!</p>
			<p>The lectures are starting to make more sense and I feel like things are coming together a little more. Out capstone project will test this and be a great barometer for where my coding currently stands. While my high level understanding is coming along, I am concerned about the details of PHP and mySQL espeically as it pertains to the technical interviews. I have started using code wars for additional PHP function training. </p>
			<h3>Week 3 Homework</h3>
			<p><strong>Direct Marketing:</strong> I am interesting in renovating an old camper trailer. I found one I was interested in and made an extremely low offer for it. Unfortunately my offer was declined.<p>
			<p><strong>Indirect Marketing:</strong> I made an offer to redo a non-profit's website. I am waiting to hear back from them whether on not they will accept my offer. <p>
			<p><strong>Salary Expectations:</strong> I believe my salary expectations are aligned with what the Albuquerque market is offering based on the wage data I reviewed as part of the class.<p>
			<p><strong>Peer Review:</strong> Sent my resume to Luther for peer review<p>
