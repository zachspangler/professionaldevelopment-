		<h3>Week 4 Reflections</h3>
		<p>This week continued the learning and we began capstone. I am excited about the project change from Netflix to Crowdvibe. I think the final product will be more impressive and I hoping that we will be able to complete in the mobile app competition at UNM in the spring.</p>
		<p>My goal for next week is to setup an LLC for my development business Skapa Development and continue work on my PWP and capstone.</p>
		<h3>Week 3 Homework</h3>
		<p><strong>Forbidden Island Takeaways:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>I felt like we had a good team dynamic, I think our group does a pretty good job expressing opinions but I want to ensure Chris feels confident expressing his ideas. He is becoming more confident and this game he was an active participant. I do fear overpowering some ideas and I need to be more open to my teammates. The biggest frustration I had was when a member of the Java class decided to come and watch our game. He was a very domineering personality and his lack of team consideration and a haziness on the rules I felt like killed the team dynamic we were fostering.
