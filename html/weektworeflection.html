			<h3>Week 2 Reflections</h3>
			<p>Week two was good. I am excited about the progress we are making. I currently have my first idea for a fun little website, it is the Dylan pun tracker. I hope to have an alpha version completed by the end of week 3.<p>
			<p>I am so excited to start being able to create web applications and can't wait to learn the full stack and how to connect. I understand it is a process so I am working on continuing to "trust the process".</p>
